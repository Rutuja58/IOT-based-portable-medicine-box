The people with Alzheimer disease or old persons who cannot remember their medicine schedules this IOT based portable medicine box is very helpful for them. This study suggests a modern healthcare solution utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) in response to the changing healthcare landscape, which is characterized by a strong movement towards home- based medical treatment [1]. Recognizing the pressing need for comprehensive healthcare solutions, particularly in situations where patients find themselves alone at home, the NodeMCU- powered smart medicine box emerges as a beacon of innovation. By seamlessly integrating a dual infrared sensor for user interaction detection and a DS3231 RTC module for precise timekeeping, this intelligent system leverages advanced technology to enhance medication adherence. Medication schedules are not only visually indicated through LEDs but also audibly communicated via alarms from an integrated buzzer and sending message to caretaker or relative of a patient through blynk app. The implementation process involves installing requisite libraries, with the code adeptly managing RTC synchronization, continuous monitoring, medicine time window checks, and interruption detection through an IR sensor then in that if interrupt is not occur then message will be sent to caretaker through blynk integration . This NodeMCU- powered smart medicine box represents a pivotal stride toward a technologically driven, user-centric healthcare ecosystem.
